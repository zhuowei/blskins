<h1>BlockLauncher Skin Upload</h1>
<p>You need an account from any of these servers in order to upload a skin.
This is to prevent other people from uploading a skin in your name.</p>
<p>Once you upload a skin, it will show up in all servers, not just the server you validated your identity with.</p>
